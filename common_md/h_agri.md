### **Best Grafting Time**

* **Late winter to early spring** (before active growth starts) for **whip & tongue, cleft, or bark grafting**.

* **Late spring to early summer** for **chip budding or T-budding** (if the rootstock is actively growing).

### \### Pruining

* pinching 
* notching 

### \### Propogation

* Hardwood Cutting Propagation
  * Take **hardwood cuttings** (from last season’s growth) during **late winter or early spring** before the buds break.
  * Cut just below a node (the point where leaves or buds grow).
  * Make a **small diagonal cut** at the bottom to increase surface area for rooting.
  * Remove leaves if there are any.
  * 
    * **Dip the cut end in rooting hormone powder** (IBA – Indole-3-butyric acid) to improve success.
  * 
    * Use a **well-draining rooting medium** like a mix of **sand and peat moss** or a **50:50 mix of perlite and vermiculite**.
  * Rooting can take **6–12 weeks**.
  * Once rooted, transfer the cuttings into pots with fertile soil and let them grow for a year before planting outdoors.

## \## ?s

* the cutting made sapling from hardwood propogration are clones of original tree so no need to graft that variety and they will bear food ealry like a grafted plant does right 
* the sucker's coming  from an apple tree are also clones of orignal tree do they need grafting for same vaerity palnt and do they bear fuit early like grafted sapling *

### **How to Speed Up Fruiting for Own-Root Trees?**

1. **Encourage Deep Root Growth:** Use **well-draining soil, deep watering, and mycorrhizal fungi** to promote a strong root system.

1. **Use Root Pruning Techniques:** Mild stress like **root pruning or root restriction** (e.g., growing in a fabric pot for a while) can push the tree to fruit earlier.

1. **Bend Branches Horizontally (Branch Training):** Helps shift the tree from vegetative to reproductive growth.

## \*

* **If the sucker comes from above the graft union** (from the scion wood), then it is a **true clone** of the original variety.
* **If the sucker comes from below the graft union** (from the rootstock), it is a clone of the rootstock, **not the fruiting variety**.

## \## Domain specefic common  logic

* ex: season effect in rooting fruiting grafting right time season etc 
* cut lower branches for fruit not down in ground and leader storng *

### \### Season

* growing seasons : fall ?

## Cuts

* Stub cuts for weak branch making
